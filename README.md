# FizzBuzz

## Fizzbuzz Task

* When a user inputs a number
* Loop from 1 to the entered number
* If the current number is divisible by 3 then print "Fizz"
* If the current number is divisible by 5 then print "Buzz"
* If the current number is divisible by 3 and 5 then print "FizzBuzz"
* Otherwise print the current number

## Practice/What I learned

* More practice with if statements and its operators like "&&"
* More practice with for loops
* First time using "parseInt", which parses a string and returns it as an integer(an actual number)
